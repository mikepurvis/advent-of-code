Advent of Code 2020
===================

I'm a new rustacean, so part of the fun of doing these challenges has been forcing myself not just
to learn idiomatic Rust, but also to understand specific language and ecosystem features.

- Day 1: Cargo, file IO, vectors, iteration, references, Result/Ok.
- Day 2: Regex, structs, derive macros, traits, templates.
- Day 3: Operator overloading.
